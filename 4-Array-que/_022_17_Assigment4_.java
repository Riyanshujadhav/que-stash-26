//In a busy hospital emergency room, patients are triaged based on their severity levels to prioritize treatment. Each patient is assigned a severity code:
// ● 0: Non-urgent cases
// ● 1: Moderately urgent cases
// ● 2: Critical cases
//The hospital's system must efficiently sort these severity levels to ensure that critical cases are attended to first, 
// followed by moderately urgent, and finally, non-urgent cases. You are tasked with writing a function 
// that takes a list of integers representing patient severity levels and sorts it in ascending order. 
// The goal is to ensure patients are categorized by their severity efficiently.
